That is the question we tackle in this course. We take the viewpoint of the new venture - and the technopreneur - strapped for resources, navigating their way through technology transfer issues. These include: readiness to do business overseas, selection of target markets, international market issues, ways of entry into international markets, start up international revenue generation and business management issues, as well as longer term international business issues. 
Course participants engage in role-playing exercises designed around an international commercialisation project. 
In the Team/Role Playing Project, you will work in teams, with each team being assigned to an imaginary `company. For each company there will be a given set of initial `facts about the technology being developed and marketed by the `company as well as certain information about staffing, funding, markets, and customers. 
The project is for the team to develop the company strategy and plan to take its technology to an international market and then to work and amend the plan as required as if in real life, including the simulated processes, steps, and activities to take the technology to the international market. 
Throughout the course, you will discuss 'war stories with Guest Speakers, the Course Co-ordinator, and fellow participants, both in live sessions and in asynchronous communication.",TECHCOMM
